# AICognition
This is a research project in Spring 2024 started by Prof Jay McKinney and Dake Peng, under the Cognitive Science Program at Carleton College, Northfield, MN.

The goals of this project is to gather and analyze published text (Blog Posts, News Articles, and Research Articles) from major companies (Google, Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic) describing AI with human cognitive terms.

We aim to investigate questions like the following:

- In what form (with what words) are AI capabilities being described in news and research publications?
- Are those descriptions the same as what we use in daily language in describing cognitive activities?
- Do they stray from how these activities are defined/described in different traditions of cognitive science? (we can add an embodied/enactive emphasis)
- Are the descriptions honest representations of the source research paper, if there is one? Did the research papers themselves misuse cognitive terms in describing AI capabilities?
